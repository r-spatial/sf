# version 1.0-16

* unless the env. variable `ADD_SF_NAMESPACE` is set to `false`, `sf` objects contain a new attribute, a dummy function called `.sf_namespace`, which is only there to force loading the `sf` namespace when it has not been loaded so far, e.g. for proper printing or plotting of an `sf` object when `library(sf)` has not been called; #2212, #2277 by Mike Mahoney

* `st_sample()` works when unprojected polygon geometry crosses the antemeridian; #2331

* clean up and modernization of S3 registration of methods and tests; #2285, #2288, #2316, #2341, #2342, by @olivroy

* `[.sfc` works when setting argument `op`; #2320

* `st_sample()` for polygons is sensitive to setting `oriented = TRUE` to prevent wrongly correcting ring directions; #2308

* add support for the GDAL `footprint` utility (requiring GDAL >= 3.8.0) to `gdal_utils`; #2305, by @goergen95

* existing environment variables `PROJ_LIB` and `PROJ_DATA` are (again) ignored on `sf` binary CRAN installations (win + macos), effectively by overwriting them during the R session and restoring them on exit; this does not happen if environment variable `R_SF_USE_PROJ_DATA` is set to `true`. #2298

* add `st_line_project()` to find how far a point is when projected on a line; #2291

* add `st_line_interpolate()` to obtain a point at a certain distance along a line; #2291

* `st_transform()` responds to in-session changes to `sf_proj_network()`; #2166

* `plot.sf()`: `key.width` is sensitive to pointsize graphics parameter `par("ps")`; keys with factor levels suggest a proper size if they won't fit.

* `plot.sf()`: `key.pos` can hold a second value in [0, 1] determining the relative position of the key in the available space 

* `[<-.sf` fixes the `agr` attribute when it is broken; #2211

* if the env. variable `ADD_SF_NAMESPACE` is set to `true`, `sf` objects get a new attribute, `.sf_namespace`, which forces loading the `sf` namespace when it has not been loaded so far, e.g. for proper printing or plotting of an `sf` object; #2212 by Mike Mahoney

* `distinct.sf()` is type-safe for `sf` objects with zero rows; #2204

* `summarise.sf()` raises an error if `.by` is given but no `across()` on the geometry; #2207

* `st_write()` matches fields on name first, than on position; this matters for formats that have pre-defined names, such as GPX; #2202

* conversion to GEOS uses the `GEOS_PREC_VALID_OUTPUT` flag, which makes sure that the "[o]utput is always valid. Collapsed geometry elements (including both polygons and lines) are removed."

# version 1.0-10

* `st_crs(x)$ud_unit` returns the unit of the coordinate reference system of `x`

* geometric predicates return `sgbp` objects omitting self-intersections etc. by passing `remove_self = TRUE` and unique symmetric relationship by passing `retain_unique = TRUE` (to `...` if needed); this simplifies identifying (and removing) duplicated geometries; duplicates are identified by e.g. by `st_equals(x, retain_unique = TRUE) |> unlist() |> unique()`; #1893

* when `st_crs()` is called with a WKT2 as text input, its `input` field will be replaced with the CRS name (if it has one).

# version 1.0-1

* fix regression in `st_intersection()`: when using s2 attributes were assigned wrongly; #1704

* `st_sample()` directly interfaces `spatstat` sampling methods, e.g. `type = "Thomas"` calls `spatstat::rThomas` after converting input arguments (window) and converts returned `ppp` object to `sf`'s `POINT` geometries; #1204 with help from Ege Rubak and Jakub Nowosad

* `sf_project()` gains an option `keep = TRUE` to return `Inf` values for points not projectable; #1228

* `st_centroid.sf()` and `st_point_on_surface.sf` also warn if attributes are not constant over geometries.

* `summarise()` allows the user to define geometries for summaries; #714, by Kirill Mueller

* `plot.sf()` emits a warning if `col` does not have length 1 or `nrow(x)`, and requires `pal` (rather than `col`) to set a palette for factors.

* `plot.sf()` provides control over legend keys using `key.length` and `key.width`, decrease default key length; #731

* `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` for pairs of geometries (`sfg`, `sfc`) return geometric union, difference, intersection and symmetric difference, respectively.

* `st_cast()` from `MULTIPOLYGON` to `MULTILINESTRING` should work properly; #660

* all Rcpp interfaces needed by package `stars` have been moved into `sf`; pkg `stars` is R-only, and only `sf` needs linking to GDAL.

* `gdal_utils()` interfaces the 9 gdal utils using the C++ API

* improve resetting (base) plots; add `reset = FALSE` in a call to `plot` to enable adding to plots that have a legend

* `st_read()` returns a `data.frame` when a table contains no geometries, rather than giving an error; it does emit a warning in this case. See https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2018-February/026344.html

* `st_is_within_distance` works with geographic coordinates

* `st_cast` from `MULTIPOLYGON` to `MULTILINESTRING` no longer changes the number of features/feature geometries, but conversion from `MULTIPOLYGON` to `LINESTRING` (typically) does; #596

* `plot.sf` and `st_as_grob` (used by ggplot2) are robust against misspecified ring directions (holes that have the same direction as the exterior rings), by using `rule = "evenodd"`; #540

* functions depending on `liblwgeom` (`st_make_valid`, `st_geohash`, `st_plit`) have been moved to their own package, https://github.com/r-spatial/lwgeom; argument `use_gdal` of `st_transform` has been deprecated, instead one can use `lwgeom::st_transform_proj`; sf no longer tries to link to liblwgeom; #509, #537, #487

* `st_read`, `st_sf` and `st_sfc` gain a parameter `check_ring_dir` (default: `FALSE`) that checks ring directions and corrects to: exterior counter clockwise, holes clockwise, when seen from above.

* `st_intersection`, `st_union` and so on also print a message when used directly on long/lat coordinates; #496

* add `rep` method for `sfc` objects

# version 0.4-1

* restore 3.3.0 and c++11 requirement

* `st_write` writes time always as UTC, since GDAL does not have a mechanism to define local timezones other than "unknown" or "local"

* `st_length` works for POINT and MULTIPOINT (returning 0); POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON are converted to MULTILINESTRING before computing length, thus giving polygon perimeter (#268)

* `st_write` has `update` depend on driver; for databases, the default is `TRUE`, otherwise `FALSE` (it refers to update of the database, and not to overwriting the table in the database, this will by default not succeed); #274

* `st_read` supports reading objects with multiple geometry columns #257 #255

* support writing (exporting) objects with non-standard columns, such as `units` or `POSIXlt` #264

* support ggplot'ing geometrycollections

* drop C++11 requirement, allowing build for older R versions

* add `st_proj_info`, modelled after `rgdal::projInfo`

* overwriting datasets with `st_write()` is no longer allowed; `update=TRUE` appends to them, permitted the driver supports appending.

* `st_write` gains an argument, `update`, which when `TRUE` will try to append to existing datasets (#204)

* added list of corresponding function for migration from sp, rgdal and rgeos to sf at https://github.com/edzer/sfr/wiki/migrating

* remove deprecated `st_list`

* rename `st_makegrid` to `st_make_grid`, and `st_linemerge` to `st_line_merge`
