# sfr: simple features for R

# The problem
_What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should include a brief summary of existing work, such as other packages. If you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of support from a member of R core._

# The plan
_How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?_

# How can the ISC help
_What can we do to help you? If you need money, how much? How will you spend it? We expect that most of the budget will be on people, but we will  consider funding travel and equipment if you have good justification. How can we help promote your project? How else could we help?_

_Please note that the budget for the ISC is currently limited. We are likely to fund one or two projects with a budget of $20-30k projects, and handful of projects with budgets of  of $5-10k. We do not pay overhead._

# Dissemination

_How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number of people? What open source license will you use? How will host your code so that others can contribute? How will you publicise your work? We encourage you to plan at least two blog posts to the R consortium blog: once to announce the project, and one to write up what you achieved._
