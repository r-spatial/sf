Simple Features: Spatial Data in R the Modern Way

Support for handling and analyzing spatial data in R goes back a long
way. In 2003 a group of package developers sat together and decided
to adopt a shared understanding of how spatial data are organized
in R, which led to the package sp, and helper packages rgdal and
rgeos. It offers simple classes for points, lines, polygons and
grids, possibly associated with further properties (attributes),
and takes care of coordinate reference systems.  The sp package has
helped many, and has made it attractive to develop new packages
that share this understanding by reusing these classes. Today,
around 350 packages directly depend on sp, many more indirectly.

After 2003, the rest of the world has broadly settled on adopting
a standard for so-called "features", which can be thought of
"things" in the real world that have a geometry along with other
properties. A feature geometry is called simple when it consists
of points connected by straight line pieces, and does not intersect
itself. Simple feature access [1] is a standard [2] for accessing
and exchanging spatial data (points, lines, polygons) as well as for
operations defined on them that has been adopted widely over the
past ten years, e.g. by spatial databases such as PostGIS [3] but
also more recent standards such as GeoJSON [4]. The sp package and
supporting packages such as rgdal and rgeos predate this standard,
which complicates exchange and handling of simple feature data.

The "Simple Features for R" project [5], one of the projects
supported by the R consortium in its first funding round, addresses
these problems by implementing simple features as native R data. The
resulting package, called "sf" [6] provides functionality similar
to the sp, rgdal for vector data, and rgeos packages together, but for simple
features. Instead of S4 classes used by the sp family, it extends R's
data.frame directly, adding a list-column for geometries. This makes
it easier to manipulate them with other tools that assume all data
objects are data.frames, such as dplyr and tidyverse.  Package sf
links to the GDAL, PROJ and GEOS libraries, three major swiss army
knifes of open source geospatial, for respectively input/output,
cartographic (re)projections, and geometric operations (e.g. unions,
buffers, intersections and topological relations). As such, it can
be seen as a successor to sp, rgdal for vector data, and rgeos.

The simple feature standard describes two encodings: well-known
text, a human readable form that looks like "POINT(10 12)" or
"LINESTRING(4 0,3 2,5 1)", and well-known binary, a simple binary
serialization. The sf package can read and write both.  Exchange
routines for binary encodings were written in Rcpp, to allow for
very fast exchange of data with the linked GDAL and GEOS libraries,
but also with other data formats or spatial databases.

The sf project on github [5] has received a lot of attention,
over 100 issues were raised, many of which received dozens of
valuable contributions, and several projects currently under
development (mapview, tmap, stplanr) are experimenting with
the new data classes. Several authors have provided useful pull
requests. Spatial analysis in pipe-based workflows, support for
dplyr-style verbs as well as integration with ggplot has started,
and is a continuing effort.

Besides using data.frames and considerably simpler data structures
for spatial geometries, advantages of sf over the sp family include
a simpler handling of coordinate reference systems (using either
EPSG code or PROJ.4 string), the ability to return distance or area
values with proper units (which can be meter, feet or US feet),
and support for using functions of package geosphere to compute
distances or areas for longitude/latitude data, using datum-dependent
values for the Earth's radius and flattening.

The sf package is now available from CRAN [6], both in source form
as in binary form for Windows and MacOSX platforms. The authors are
greatful to the CRAN team for their strong support in getting the
sf package compiled on all platforms. Support from the R Consortium
has helped greatly to give this project priority, draw attention
in a wider community, and facilitate travel and communication events.
