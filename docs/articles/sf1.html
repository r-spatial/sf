<div class="contents">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features">Simple features</a> or <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa"><em>simple feature access</em></a> refers to a <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40114">formal standard</a> that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in computers, with emphasis on the <em>spatial</em> geometry of these objects. It also describes how such objects can be stored in and retrieved from databases, and which geometrical operations should be defined for them.</p>
<p>The standard is widely implemented in spatial databases (such as PostGIS), commercial GIS (e.g., <a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI ArcGIS</a>) and forms the vector data basis for libraries such as <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a>. A subset of simple features forms the <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> standard.</p>
<p>R has well-supported classes for storing spatial data (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp">sp</a>) and interfacing to the above mentioned environments (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal">rgdal</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgeos">rgeos</a>), but has so far lacked a complete implementation of simple features, making conversions at times convoluted, inefficient or incomplete. The package <a href="http://github.com/edzer/sfr">sf</a> tries to fill this gap, and aims at succeeding <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp">sp</a> in the long term.</p>
<p>This vignette:</p>
<ul><li>explains what is meant by features, and by simple features</li>
<li>shows how they are implemented in R</li>
<li>provides examples of how you can work with them</li>
<li>shows how they can be read from and written to external files or resources</li>
<li>discusses how they can be converted to and from sp objects</li>
<li>shows how they can be used for meaningful spatial analysis</li>

<h1 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#what-is-a-feature" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>What is a feature?</h1>
<p>A feature is thought of as a thing, or an object in the real world, such as a building or a tree. As is the case with objects, they often consist of other objects. This is the case with features too: a set of features can form a single feature. A forest stand can be a feature, a forest can be a feature, a city can be a feature. A satellite image pixel can be a feature, a complete image can be a feature too.</p>
<p>Features have a <em>geometry</em> describing <em>where</em> on Earth the feature is located, and they have attributes, which describe other properties. The geometry of a tree can be the delineation of its crown, of its stem, or the point indicating its centre. Other properties may include its height, color, diameter at breast height at a particular date, and so on.</p>
<p>The standard says: &ldquo;<em>A simple feature is defined by the OpenGIS Abstract specification to have both spatial and non-spatial attributes. Spatial attributes are geometry valued, and simple features are based on 2D geometry with linear interpolation between vertices.</em>&rdquo; We will see soon that the same standard will extend its coverage beyond 2D and beyond linear interpolation. Here, we take simple features as the data structures and operations described in the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa">standard</a>.</p>
<div id="dimensions" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#dimensions" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Dimensions</h2>
<p>All geometries are composed of points. Points are coordinates in a 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional space. All points in a geometry have the same dimensionality. In addition to X and Y coordinates, there are two optional additional dimensions:</p>
<ul><li>a Z coordinate, denoting altitude</li>
<li>an M coordinate (rarely used), denoting some <em>measure</em> that is associated with the point, rather than with the feature as a whole (in which case it would be a feature attribute); examples could be time of measurement, or measurement error of the coordinates</li>
</ul><p>The four possible cases then are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>two-dimensional points refer to x and y, easting and northing, or longitude and latitude, we refer to them as XY</li>
<li>three-dimensional points as XYZ</li>
<li>three-dimensional points as XYM</li>
<li>four-dimensional points as XYZM (the third axis is Z, fourth M)</li>
</ol></div>
<div id="simple-feature-geometry-types" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#simple-feature-geometry-types" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Simple feature geometry types</h2>
<p>The following seven simple feature types are the most common, and are for instance the only ones used for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946">GeoJSON</a>:</p>
<table style="width:78%;" class="table"><colgroup><col width="6%"><col width="70%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">type</th>

<td align="left">geometry with a positive area (two-dimensional); sequence of points form a closed, non-self intersecting ring; the first ring denotes the exterior ring, zero or more subsequent rings denote holes in this exterior ring</td>

Empty geometries can be thought of being the analogue to missing (<code>NA</code>) attributes, NULL values or empty lists.</p>
<p>The remaining geometries 10 are more rare, but increasingly find implementations:</p>

<td align="left">The CIRCULARSTRING is the basic curve type, similar to a LINESTRING in the linear world. A single segment requires three points, the start and end points (first and third) and any other point on the arc. The exception to this is for a closed circle, where the start and end points are the same. In this case the second point MUST be the center of the arc, ie the opposite side of the circle. To chain arcs together, the last point of the previous arc becomes the first point of the next arc, just like in LINESTRING. This means that a valid circular string must have an odd number of points greated than 1.</td>
</tr><tr class="even"><td align="left"><code>COMPOUNDCURVE</code></td>
<td align="left">A compound curve is a single, continuous curve that has both curved (circular) segments and linear segments. That means that in addition to having well-formed components, the end point of every component (except the last) must be coincident with the start point of the following component.</td>

<p>Coordinates can only be placed on the Earth&rsquo;s surface when their coordinate reference system (CRS) is known; this may be an elipsoidal CRS such as WGS84, a projected, two-dimensional (Cartesian) CRS such as a UTM zone or Web Mercator, or a CRS in three-dimensions or <a href="http://www.faculty.jacobs-university.de/pbaumann/iu-bremen.de_pbaumann/Papers/acmgis-2012_crs-nts.pdf">including time</a>. Similarly, M-coordinates need an attribute reference system, e.g.&nbsp;a <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=units">measurement unit</a>.</p>

<h1 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#how-simple-features-in-r-are-organized" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>How simple features in R are organized</h1>
<p>Package <code>sf</code> represents simple features as native R objects. All functions and methods in <code>sf</code> are prefixed by <code>st_</code>, so that they are easily found by command-line completion. Simple features are implemented as R native data, using simple data structures (S3 classes, lists, matrix, vector). Typical use involves reading, manipulating and writing of sets of features, with attributes and geometries.</p>
<p>As attributes are typically stored in <code>data.frame</code> objects (or the very similar <code>tbl_df</code>), we will also store feature geometries in a <code>data.frame</code> column. Since geometries are not single-valued, they are put in a list-column, a list of length equal to the number of records in the <code>data.frame</code>, with each list element holding the simple feature geometry of that feature. The three classes used to represent simple features are:</p>
<ul><li><code>sf</code>, the table (<code>data.frame</code>) with feature attributes and feature geometries, which contains</li>
<li><code>sfc</code>, the list-column with the geometries for each feature (record), which is composed of</li>
<li><code>sfg</code>, the feature geometry of an individual simple feature.</li>
</ul><p>We will now discuss each of these three classes.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#sf-objects-with-simple-features" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>sf: objects with simple features</h2>
<p>As we usually do not work with geometries of single simple features, but with datasets consisting of sets of features with attributes, the two are put together in <code>sf</code> (simple feature) objects. The following command reads the <code>nc</code> dataset from a file that is contained in the <code>sf</code> package:</p>

<p>(Note that users will not use  but give a  directly, and that shapefiles consist of more than one file, all with identical basename, which reside in the same directory.) The short report printed gives the file name, the driver (ESRI Shapefile), mentions that there are 100 features (records, represented as rows) and 14 fields (attributes, represented as columns). This object is of class</p>

<p>It is also possible to create <code>data.frame</code> objects with geometry list-columns that are not of class <code>sf</code>, e.g.&nbsp;by</p>

<p>The way this is printed is called <em>well-known text</em>, and is part of the standards. The word <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code> is followed by three parenthesis, because it can consist of multiple polygons, in the form of <code>MULTIPOLYGON(POL1,POL2)</code>, where <code>POL1</code> might consist of an exterior ring and zero or more interior rings, as of <code>(EXT1,HOLE1,HOLE2)</code>. Sets of coordinates are held together with parenthesis, so we get <code>((crds_ext)(crds_hole1)(crds_hole2))</code> where <code>crds_</code> is a comma-separated set of coordinates of a ring. This leads to the case above, where <code>MULTIPOLYGON(((crds_ext)))</code> refers to the exterior ring (1), without holes (2), of the first polygon (3) - hence three parentheses.</p>
<p>We can see there is a single polygon with no rings:</p>

<p>These two are fundamentally different: <code>GEOMETRY</code> is a superclass without instances, <code>GEOMETRYCOLLECTION</code> is a geometry instance. <code>GEOMETRY</code> list-columns occur when we read in a data source with a mix of geometry types. <code>GEOMETRYCOLLECTION</code> <em>is</em> a single feature&rsquo;s geometry: the intersection of two feature polygons may consist of points, lines and polygons, see the example <a href="#geometrycollection">below</a>.</p>

<p>Simple feature geometry (<code>sfg</code>) objects carry the geometry for a single feature, e.g.&nbsp;a point, linestring or polygon.</p>
<p>Simple feature geometries are implemented as R native data, using the following rules</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>a single POINT is a numeric vector</li>
<li>a set of points, e.g.&nbsp;in a LINESTRING or ring of a POLYGON is a <code>matrix</code>, each row containing a point</li>
<li>any other set is a <code>list</code></li>
</ol><p>Creator functions are rarely used in practice, since we typically bulk read and write spatial data. They are useful for illustration:</p>

<p>This means that we can represent 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional coordinates. All geometry objects inherit from <code>sfg</code> (simple feature geometry), but also have a type (e.g. <code>POINT</code>), and a dimension (e.g. <code>XYM</code>) class name. A figure illustrates six of the seven most common types.</p>
<p>With the exception of the <code>POINT</code> which has a single point as geometry, the remaining six common single simple feature geometry types that correspond to single features (single records, or rows in a <code>data.frame</code>) are created like this</p>

<p>GDAL, GEOS, spatial databases and GIS read and write WKB which is fast and precise. Conversion between R native objects and WKB is done by package <code>sf</code> in compiled (C++/Rcpp) code, making this a reusable and fast route for I/O of simple feature geometries in R.</p>

<div id="precision" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#precision" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Precision</h3>
<p>One of the attributes of a geometry list-column (<code>sfc</code>) is the <code>precision</code>: a double number that, when non-zero, causes some rounding during conversion to WKB, which might help certain geometrical operations succeed that would otherwise fail due to floating point representation. The model is that of GEOS, which copies from the Java Topology Suite (<a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html">JTS</a>), and works like this:</p>
<ul><li>if precision is zero (default, unspecified), nothing is modified</li>
<li>negative values convert to float (4-byte real) precision</li>
<li>positive values convert to <code>round(x*precision)/precision</code>.</li>
</ul><p>For the precion model, see also <a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/javadoc/com/vividsolutions/jts/geom/PrecisionModel.html">here</a>, where it is written that: &ldquo;&hellip; to specify 3 decimal places of precision, use a scale factor of 1000. To specify -3 decimal places of precision (i.e.&nbsp;rounding to the nearest 1000), use a scale factor of 0.001.&rdquo; Note that all coordinates, so also <code>Z</code> or <code>M</code> values (if present) are affected. Choosing values for <code>precision</code> may require some experimenting.</p>

<p>The <code>dsn</code> and <code>layer</code> arguments to <code>st_read</code> and <code>st_write</code> denote a data source name and optionally a layer name. Their exact interpretation as well as the options they support vary per driver, the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html">GDAL driver documentation</a> is best consulted for this. For instance, a PostGIS table in database <code>postgis</code> might be read by</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">meuse &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/st_read.html">st_read</a></span>(<span class="st">"PG:dbname=postgis"</span>, <span class="st">"meuse"</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>where the <code>PG:</code> string indicates this concerns the PostGIS driver, followed by database name, and possibly port and user credentials.</p>
<p><code>st_read</code> typically reads the coordinate reference system as <code>proj4string</code>, but not the EPSG (SRID). GDAL cannot retrieve SRID (EPSG code) from <code>proj4string</code> strings, and, when needed, it has to be set by the user. See also the section on <a href="crs" class="uri">crs</a>.</p>
<p>Two further functions, <code>st_read_db</code> and <code>st_write_db</code> attempt to read and write directly from spatial databases, using WKB. The advantage over <code>st_read</code> may be that instead of a complete table, the result of a (spatial) query may be fetched, limiting the amount of data that is read into R.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/st_drivers.html">st_drivers()</a></code> returns a <code>data.frame</code> listing available drivers, and their metadata: names, whether a driver can write, and whether it is a raster and/or vector driver. All drivers can read. Reading of some common data formats is illustrated below:</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor"><html><body><a href="#crs" class="anchor"> </a></body></html>Coordinate reference systems and transformations</h2>
<p>Coordinate reference systems (CRS) are like measurement units for coordinates: they specify which location on Earth a particular coordinate pair refers to. We saw above that <code>sfc</code> objects (geometry list-columns) have two attributes to store a CRS: <code>epsg</code> and <code>proj4string</code>. This implies that all geometries in a geometry list-column must have the same CRS. Both may be <code>NA</code>, e.g.&nbsp;in case the CRS is unknown, or when we work with local coordinate systems (e.g.&nbsp;inside a building, a body, or an abstract space).</p>
<p><code>proj4string</code> is a generic, string-based description of a CRS, understood by the <a href="http://proj4.org/">PROJ.4</a> library. It defines projection types and (often) defines parameter values for particular projections, and hence can cover an infinite amount of different projections. This library (also used by GDAL) provides functions to convert or transform between different CRS. <code>epsg</code> is the integer ID for a particular, known CRS that can be resolved into a <code>proj4string</code>. There is no (known, simple and general) way to resolve <code>proj4string</code> values into <code>epsg</code> IDs.</p>
<p>The importance of having <code>epsg</code> values stored with data besides <code>proj4string</code> values is that the <code>epsg</code> refers to particular, well-known CRS, whose parameters may change (improve) over time; fixing only the <code>proj4string</code> may remove the possibility to benefit from such improvements, and limit the provenance of datasets.</p>
<p>Coordinate reference system transformations can be carried out using <code>st_transform</code>, e.g.&nbsp;converting longitudes/latitudes in NAD27 to web mercator (EPSG:3875) can be done by</p>

<p>As the <code>Spatial*</code> objects only support <code>MULTILINESTRING</code> and <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code>, <code>LINESTRING</code> and <code>POLYGON</code> geometries are automatically coerced into their <code>MULTI</code> form. When converting <code>Spatial*</code> into <code>sf</code>, if all geometries consist of a single <code>POLYGON</code> (possibly with holes), a <code>POLYGON</code> and otherwise all geometries are returned as <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code>: a mix of <code>POLYGON</code> and <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code> (such as common in shapefiles) is not created. Argument <code>forceMulti=TRUE</code> will override this, and create <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code>s in all cases. For <code>LINES</code> the situation is identical.</p>

<p>The standard documents about simple features are very detailed about the geometric aspects of features, but say nearly nothing about attributes, except that their values should be understood in another reference system (their <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=units">units of measurement</a>). But there is more to it. For variables like air temperature, interpolation makes usually sense, for others like human body temperature it doesn&rsquo;t. The difference is that air temperature is a field, which continues between sensors, where body temperature is an object property that doesn&rsquo;t extend beyond the body &ndash; in spatial statistics bodies would be called a point pattern, their temperature the point marks. For geometries that have a non-zero size (positive length or area), attribute values may refer to the every sub-geometry (every point), or may summarize the geometry. For example, a state&rsquo;s population density summarizes the whole state, and is not a meaningful estimate of population density for a give point inside the state without the context of the state. On the other hand, land use or geological maps give polygons with constant land use or geology, every point inside the polygon is of that class. Some properties are spatially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties">extensive</a>, meaning that attributes would summed up when two geometries are merged: population is an example. Other properties are spatially intensive, and should be averaged, with population density the example.</p>
<p>Simple feature objects of class <code>sf</code> have an attribute that points out how attributes relate to their geometry, which can be defined at creation time:</p>
